Click on Pages in the left sidebar.

❓ Troubleshooting

Image not showing?

The code prioritizes cover.jpg. Ensure the filename is lowercase.

If cover.jpg is missing, the code automatically switches to the Google Books API image (id=nk-3EQAAQBAJ).

If neither works, check your internet connection (since CDN resources like Tailwind and Icons need internet).
